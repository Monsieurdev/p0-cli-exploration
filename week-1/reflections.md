1.1 Think About Time

The ideas that I learned are  the notion of swapping "have for want", and second meditation. for instance, in one of the sources listed above, there is part that talks about processing a "To do list" whether it's for our daily activities or tasks in our job, suggests that one should swap a "To do list" for "Get to do list" or "Want to do list". I find this very interesting, I think this could preset your mind to tackle goals more effectively. Now on to meditation. I think it is a very powerful tool for productivity, I just realized I was practicing meditation but I just didn't know it. for example, when I was trying my hand on few coding challenges before I got accepted in DBC, I always found myself stuck at some point, what would do, I took a break, cleared my mind of everything and relaxed for few minutes, and many times I came back strong with a solution. although this might not be a legit form of meditation, I am sure it presents me an idea of what meditation can do. Time Boxing is a time frame given in which some tasks need to be done. the difference here is that, at the end of the time, all work must stop and evaluate what was accomplished. I can consider every week of phase as Time boxings since I am expected to complete tasks by Mondays. therefore I could use these weeks as Time Boxings. I currently mage my time by applying the "Want to do list" that I learned from the sources provided. I think it is working because work is being done.  

1.2 The Command Line 

1. A shell is a user interface in an UNIX operating system that takes commands from user and execute them. And bash, a default shell for Linux and OS X is a Unix shell and command language developed for the GNU project and successor of the Bourne Shell.
2. I was having hard times with the pipe and redirecting section. but with a little persistence I was able to understand what the commands do.
3. Yes, I was able to get them to work, some parts were often unclear to me but with the help of some online search, I made my way through them. 
4. I would say the basic commands for beginners are the more important such as making directories, create files, switch between directories and son on.
5. pwd : shows you the current working directory.
ls : lists directory
mv: rename file or directory
../ : move up one directory or access direct parent directory
cd: changes directory
touch: create a file
mkdir: make directory
less: display the content of a text file in an independent screen
rmdir: remove directory if it's empty.
rm : remove file or directory 
help: provide help with what a command does

1.4 Forking and Cloning

I would say the following instructions : to create a repository, on your Github page click on the plus sign at the top right corner,name you repository in the field where it says "Repository Name". Next make it public by selecting the public option, give it a MIT license by clicking the drop down list "Add a license" and finally click on the "Create Repository button". Fork the repository by clicking on the "Fork" button at the top right of the page. To clone the repo, select its link in Github, open your terminal type in the command "git clone" followed by the pasted link of the repo and voila. We fork a repository to have an already existing project so we can modify it as we like without changing the original repo. Fortunately, I didn't have any struggle at all when setting  up git and GitHub. I followed the instructions carefully and everything went smooth. I did learn few git commands in the process such "git install", "git init", and few others. I can't wait to learn more.
