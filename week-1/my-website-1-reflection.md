Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
From GitHub click the "plus" button at the top right corner, type your username in the field that says "Repository name", click the public option, next click the "Add license" drop down list and add an MIT license, at the bottom of the page click on "Create Repsository". Now to clone the repo, copy the link to your repo, in your your terminal do the following command "git clone" followed by the link to the repo.

Describe what open source means.
It means that anybody can access the source code of a software. make copy, mody , distribute and so on.

What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
Well it makes me feel like what a time to be alive. because it makes the world of sofware development much better and offers unlimitted sources to programmers, it doesn't make me nervous, you just have to know about the licences and use the appropriate ones for your projects.

Assess the importance of using licenses.
licenses can put in perspective what can and cannot be don with someone's product or work. these inlcude permission and restrictions primarly.

What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
The articles on open sources and licenses were mind blowing. I use to read stuff on the internet about these subjects and had no clues but now the pieces are coming together, it all makes sense. being able the run the web page was my "aha" moment I guess. luckily I didn't struggle at all. 

Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
No. Because I tend to get confused easily when I try to look in different places. so as long as the intended source works for me, I hold on untill I get comfortable and then I may look elsewhere.
